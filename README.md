# sf2hpp
A bunch of header-only libraries for SoundFont2 loading and sound synthesis.

Written against SoundFont 2.4 specification, but contains fixes for non-conformant soundfonts.
Supports polyphonic audio rendering.
Doesn't support Modulators and Continuous Controllers, but supports Sustain and what is otherwise necessary for correct playback.

To get started, see this [example](<https://github.com/AnonN10/sf2hpp/blob/master/example.cpp>).
